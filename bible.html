         <h1>How was the bible formed?</h1><br>
         <p class="sentence_one">The old testament was written around 7th century B.C and is the first part of the bible which is from the torah which is within Judaism. The old testament has 39 books which are; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi.<br>

<br>When Jesus was born he was born from a virgin mother. He had no biological farther, and of course we know that we need a woman and a man to create a child. There is no other explanation apart from that Jesus came from God.<br>

<br>Whilst being on earth Jesus performed miracles by healing people who were sick, raising many from the dead and fulfilling prophecies in the old testament. When Jesus done this people around began to follow him and accept his word as the truth which is understandable. He told people the words of God and meantioned he was there at the beginning with God.<br> 

<br>As time grew and Jesus began to gain many followers, admirers and disciples.<br>

<br>After Jesus died many eye witnesses of Jesus wrote accounts of his life. This is where we get the Gospels in the new testament which are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.<br>

<br>The bible is then formed from the new and old testament and is also how the faith of Christianity is formed. "Christ"ianity.<br>


<br>The new testament is the second part of the bible which is made up of 27 books which include the 4 Gospels. The Gospels are eye witness and written testimonial accounts of Jesus' life, teachings and spoken words. The 4 Gospel books are Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. The other 23 books in the new testament are; Acts, Romans, 1 Corinthians,  2 Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hewbrews, James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, Jude and Revelation.

<br></p>


         <br><p class="heading_two">What credibility does it have?</p>
         <br><p class="sentence_two">The Bible has many prophecies that have taken place over the years. Prophecies are a prediction/s of what will happen in the future. There is 1,239 prophecies is the Old Testament and 578 prophecies in the New Testament which is a total of 1,817.<br>

<br>When considering this, it does build your faith and trust that the Bible is the true word of God. It would be too much of a coincidence for all of these prophecies to take place. There has to be a superpower/creator that warned or told us what is going to happen in the future and fast forward in the future these events did happen.<br></p>
          <br><p class="heading_three">The Old Testament</p>
          <br><p class="sentence_three">Genesis is the first book in the bible which explains the beginning time. It explains how God created earth and humanity. Genesis is part of the Torah or Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible. Tradition credits Moses as the Torah's author.</p><br>

<br>It was probably composed around the 5th century BC, although some scholars believe that primeval history (chapters 1â€“11), may have been composed and added as late as the 3rd century BC.Based on scientific interpretation of archaeological, genetic, and linguistic evidence.</p>
