            <h1>Jesus Christ Our Saviour</h1><br>
            <p class="sentence_one">Jesus Christ was born from humble beginnings within a stable in Bethlehem by the Virgin Mary with no biological human father. God spoke to Mary’s husband, Joseph, explaining that God had indeed given the gift of Jesus to Mary and Joseph. Whilst Jesus lived on earth he healed many people, permormed miracles and provided wisdom, guidance to many people who was in his presence or followed him.</p>
             <p class="heading_two">Why follow Jesus?</p><br>
             <p class="sentence_two">Jesus was crucified and died for our sins. God's Son had a mission. He came to earth to reunite us with God through the ultimate sacrifice, which was his own life. We could never live a life worthy of God on our own. So Jesus lived a life without sin on our behalf. And then he died the painful death for our sins.</p>
             <p class="heading_three">What non biblical proof do we have of Jesus?</p><br>
             <p class="sentence_three">There are many credible sources of Jesus throughout history. These sources include:</p>

             <p class="sentence_three"><strong>Josephus</strong> (37-101AD) a Jewish historian and Galilean military leader.<br>

<br><strong>Thallus</strong> (52AD) was a Greek historian. His work is considered important by some Christians as confirming the historicity of Jesus and providing non-Christian validation of the Gospel accounts.<br>

<br><strong>Tacitus</strong> (56-120AD) was a Roman historian and politician. Tacitus is widely regarded as one of the greatest Roman historians by modern scholars. His Annals are of interest for providing an early account of the persecution of Christians and one of the earliest extra-Biblical references to the crucifixion of Jesus.<br>

<br><strong>Mara Bar-Serapion</strong> (70AD) or "Mara son of Serapion", was a Syriac Stoic philosopher in the Roman province of Syria. He is only known from a letter he wrote in Syriac to his son, who was named Serapion, which refers to the execution of "the wise king of the Jews" and may be an early non-Christian reference to Jesus of Nazareth.<br>

<br><strong>Phlegon</strong> (80-140AD) Phlegon of Tralles (Ancient Greek: Φλέγων ὁ Τραλλιανός Flegon o Trallianos) was a Greek writer and freedman of the emperor Hadrian, who lived in the 2nd century AD. Phlegon, in his Chronicles, mentions Jesus: "Now Phlegon, in the thirteenth or fourteenth book, of his Chronicles, not only ascribed to Jesus a knowledge of future events and also testified that the result corresponded to His predictions."<br>

<br><strong>Pliny the Younger</strong> (61-113AD) was a lawyer, author, and magistrate of Ancient Rome. Pliny's letter implies is that he and every other Roman authority figure assumed that Jesus was a real person.</p>

  <p class="heading_four">Jesus Christ in other non Christian faiths</p><br>

     <p class="sentence_four">Jesus is also acknowledged in other faiths such as Judaism and Islam,  which also shows the proof of his existence. Judaism came before Christianity, and Islam was around 600 years later. In the bible there is the Old Testament, which is the same books found in the torah, Nevi'im and Ketuvim which are; Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, 2 Kings, 1 Chronicles, 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther
Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, 
Song of Solomon (or Song of Songs), 
Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi.<br>

<br>It is when Jesus christ came to the earth, lived his life, and was crucified and resurrected which formed Christianity and is how the new testament was formed and is how we have the old testament with the new testament in the bible. The New Testament has many prophecies fulfilled by Jesus.<br>

<br>In Islam Jesus is the only one in the Quran called the Masih (pronounced "Mass sea" also spelt; Mesih, Maseeh, Hebrew: Māshīaḥ (מָשִׁיחַ) or the Greek:  title Khristós (Χριστός) which also means the anointed one. He lived a sinless life and the Quran also states his mother was the Virgin Mary.<br>

<br>Every prophet of God is anointed by God, a Messiah. But the title al-Maseeh (or The Messiah) is exclusively reserved for Jesus.<br>

     <p class="heading_four_">Scholars and Historians</p><br>
<br>Modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, and biblical scholars and classical historians view the theories of his nonexistence as effectively refuted.<br>

(The Lords Prayer)<br>

<br>“What comes out of a person is what defiles them. For it is from within, out of a person’s heart, that evil thoughts come—sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and defile a person.” (Mark 7:20-23)<br>
