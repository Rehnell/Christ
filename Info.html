This page will also have external links to web pages, lists of books and various other materials. We hope you find this educational, uplifting and resourceful.<br>

<br>We may refer you to the Bible as well as other religious books such as the Quran, Torah etc. We will only state what is written in those religious books and will not make up, change words or state anything that is untrue, unwritten and/or inaccurate.

             <p class="heading_two">Beginning of Time</p><br>

             <p class="sentence_two">Let us go back and take a look at the beginning of time. We all have questions about how our existence started, why are we here, who created God, how planet earth began and so on.
<br>

<br>Let's discuss why Christians believe there is a creator who created our earth and universe and why Christians believe that their God/creator is eternal and is everyone's God.
<br>

<br>Over the years, humans have used science to create "theories" to try and figure out why we are here, who created us and why. A "theory" is not factual and a "theory" in science is not considered a fact. A well known theory you may have heard of is called "The Big Bang Theory", which is what many scientists and atheists claim to be the truth of our existence. However, many Christians and even other faiths such as Islam and Judaism would disapprove and here is why.<br></p>
             <p class="heading_three">Evolution & Creation</p><br>
             <p class="sentence_three">If we look at the four postulates of creation and compare them with the four postulates of evolution, only the postulates of creation have been observed. Evolution is based on four major ideas, and none of those in evolution have been observed. This can be explained below:<br>

<br><b>Four major postulates of evolution</b><br>

<br><i><b>1. Non-life comes from non-life - </i></b> We do not have one single example of life coming from non-life<br>

<br><i><b>2. Complex Plant, human and Animal life -</i></b> Bateria has single cell life forms, but to go to complex life forms like humans or animals their is no evidence we come from single cell life forms.<br>

<br><i><b>3. Time - </i></b> When we look at time and chance, it drives evolution forward, and time works against evolution. The chance of one single unit of protein coming together by accident is a trillions of trillions chance.<br>

<br><i><b>4. Evidence of major evolutionary processes are major genetic variations within species - </i></b>Minor genetic variation in species is evidence of macroevolution. So we see cats and dogs with different colours and sizes, which doesn't mean that fish can turn into cows. All the genes that exist today exist today. But there are no new genes created.<br>

<br><b>Four major postulates of creation</b><br>

<br><i><b>1.Where there is a design, there must be a designer - </i></b> We see codes in DNA. The codes of evidence of intelligence.  Because you have to translate from one language to another. We don't have a single example of this happening by accident.<br>

<br><i><b>2. The earth, solar system, and the galaxy are young - </i></b>This is measured in 1000s of years, not billions of years. You can prove this without using the bible. The oldest living thing on the planet is trees. What is the age of the oldest trees? This is around 4500 years ago. Which takes us back to around the year of the flood. (Which is in the bible).<br>

<br>When you look at the sky, there is solar nemuli. A solar nemuli is what we see when a solar supernova explodes, which leaves a gas cloud. Because of our radio telescopes that we have now, we can count the number of solar nemuli that are there. A supernova occurs once every 26 years, and we have 6000 years' worth. If the earth is billions of years old, the amount of solar nemuli we have would be impossible for an earth that is billions of years old. Alpha decay research shows that the earth is around 6000 years old also.<br> 
 
<br><i><b>3. Limitations  - </i></b>Dogs can breed dogs, but you can't breed dogs with cats, so there are limitations to what different species can do.<br>

<br><i><b>4. The worldwide flood around 2500 BC - </i></b>The world experienced a flood 1656 years after the world was created. The world is filled with limestone, which is a sedimentary rock. You can find this on top of mountains in every country in the world, including Mount Everest has sealife on top of the mountain. The mountains rose out of the water so we know there was a worldwide flood.<br>

<p class="heading_three">Reasons why there is a God</p><br>

<br>1. The big bang theory - If the big bang occurred, the universe has a discrete moment of creation, and this moment of creation requires a cause, and yet it is one outside of time and matter, and other properties of the universe. It is consistent that this "uncaused cause" would be a mind.<br>

<br>2. Order and Design - A natural world as complex and organised as ours demands an intelligent mind, not accident or chance to originate. We have little evidence to support ordered things coming from disorder, only from an ordered mind.<br>

<br>3. Life comes from life, not from nonlife, and reason comes from reason, not nonreason. - If we are just highly developed monkeys, why should we believe anything we think? Without God, our rational mind comes from the non-rational.<br>
