            <h1>Welcome everyone</h1>
            <p class="sentence_one">This page is for those who would like to know more about Christianity or to boost people's faith for those who are already Christians, and to learn more about God, Jesus and the Bible. This page will also have external links to web pages, lists of books and various other materials. We hope you find this educational, uplifting and resourceful.<br>
                
<br><b>Disclaimer:</b> This page is an unapologetic Christianity page. It is not here to cause offense to anyone. We want to share knowledge from scholars, historians and other educated professionals.<br>
                
<br>We may refer you to the Bible as well as other religious books such as the Quran, Torah etc. We will only state what is written in those religious books and will not make up, change words or state anything that is untrue, unwritten and/or inaccurate. If you would like to continue reading, we are happy that you will. Let's share the good news with you all below:</p><br>

             <p class="heading_two">Beginning of Time</p><br>

<br>Let us go back and take a look at the beginning of time. We all have questions about how our existence started, why are we here, who created God, how planet earth began and so on.
<br>

<br>Let's discuss why Christians believe there is a creator who created our earth and universe and why Christians believe that their God/creator is eternal and is everyone's God.
<br>

<br>Over the years, humans have used science to create "theories" to try and figure out why we are here, who created us and why. A "theory" is not factual and a "theory" in science is not considered a fact. A well known theory you may have heard of is called "The Big Bang Theory", which is what many scientists and atheists claim to be the truth of our existence. However, many Christians and even other faiths such as Islam and Judaism would disapprove and here is why.<br>
                
             <p class="sentence_two">Learning the bible is a great way to understand the word of God and learn the spoken words and life of Jesus. The bible can be read alone or with a group of fellow disciples. There is no right or wrong way of reading the bible. The bible can be read from start to finish. You may want to start with the New Testament or possibly from a section of the Old Testament.<br>

<br>The bible has many scriptures providing wisdom and guidance about how to live our lives, connecting with God, understanding our existence and our purpose.</p>
             <p class="heading_three">Attending Church</p><br>
             <p class="sentence_three">There is many scriptures within the bible that encouragesus to attend church. One of them is this one below:<br>

<br><i>“And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds, not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another — and all the more as you see the Day approaching” (Hebrews 10:24-25).</i><br>

<br>Attending church is not only beneficial to your faith but it helps other disciples with their faith as you can learn, share life and faith experiences with others.</p>
             <p class="heading_four">Praying</p><br>

<p class="sentence_four">Praying is a moment when we put time aside to show or love, share concerns and wish wellness for others with God. There is no right or wrong way to pray. Some people may find it uncomfortable and feel that they are not praying properly. However, opening your heart to God, you will see that there is no right or wrong way.<br>

<br>Jesus was once Praying and one of his disciples came up to him and asked Jesus "can  you teach us how to pray?" Jesus replied to his disciple and said to him:<br>

<br><i>"Our Father in heaven,
hallowed be your name,
your kingdom come,
your will be done,
on earth as in heaven.
Give us today our daily bread.
Forgive us our sins
as we forgive those who sin against us.
Lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil.
For the kingdom, the power,
and the glory are yours
now and for ever.
Amen."</i></p>

             <p class="heading_five">Fellowship</p><br>

<p class="sentence_five">Fellowship promotes spiritual growth. Proverbs 27:17 tells us, <i>"As iron sharpens iron, so one person sharpens another."</i><br>

<br>Through fellowship, we challenge and uplift one another, sharing what each one has learned from God's Word and holding each other accountable in our walk with Christ.<br>

<br>Fellowship is the act of meeting with those who are converted and who possess the same beliefs.<br>

<br>Within your community it helps you build and grow your faith, gain a better understanding of God, Jesus, the bible, prayers and everything else that makes you a disciple.<br>

<br>Everybody has bad days. We might have lost a loved one, we might be depressed or encounter many other reasons such as financial difficulties, struggling with faith. The fellowship helps by spending time with other disciples, as other disciples may share knowledge, wisdom or even share the same experiences as you prior. This may be able to help you get back on track with your faith and maintain your focus on God.<br>
                 <p class="heading_six">Beginning of time</p><br>
           <p class="sentence_six">Let us go back and take a look at the beginning of time. We all have questions about how our exsistance started, why are we here, who created God, how did planet earth begin and so on.<br>

<br>It is normal to be inquisitive, after all these are big questions. Alot of times curiosity is what leads people to God.<br> 

<p class="heading_seven">Reasons why there is a God</p><br>

<p class="sentence_seven">

1. <i>The big bang theory</i> - If the big bang occurred, the universe has a discrete moment of creation, and this moment of creation requires a cause, and yet it is one outside of time and matter, and other properties of the universe. It is consistent that this "uncaused cause" would be a mind.<br>

<br>2. <i>Order and Design</i> - A natural world as complex and organised as ours demands an intelligent mind, not accident or chance to originate. We have little evidence to support ordered things coming from disorder, only from an ordered mind.<br>

<br>3. <i>Life comes from life, not from nonlife, and reason comes from reason, not nonreason.</i> - If we are just highly developed monkeys, why should we believe anything we think? Without God, our rational mind comes from the non-rational.<br>
