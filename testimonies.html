            <p class="sentence_one">Disciples are those that have taken the conscious decision to be born again and accept Jesus Christ. Disciples will give their Testimony which is a journey of their life, faith and why they decided to follow Jesus.<br>

<br>Take a look below at some testimonies from people of all walks of life. There is sometimes a stigma that you must be perfect and that you can not be forgiven for your sins. However, we all life sinful lives. We are all not perfect. We hope this page provides inspiration to those who are interested in becoming a disciple or looking for answers. Sometimes, in life, your faith will be tested and it can become difficult. This is why togetherness, sharing of faith and testimony is helpful and great for yourself and others.</p>

             <p class="sentence_two">Hi, I'm Rehnell, the creator of this website. My journey has been an eventful one. I started off from humble beginnings on an east London estate. I used to idolise famous people, rappers, clothing, cars and all things that are materialistic.<br>

<br>I used to get involved in things I shouldn't have, but for some reason God always protected me. I loved sex and always used to have nights out looking for fornication. I met Ruby in 2008, who is now my wife. We met in central London in a nightclub coincidentaly, and we are still together today.<br>

<br>My wife was not interested, like myself, in Jesus and in Christianity. However, one thing we had in common was we both believed in God. My wife became a disciple in 2021, and I still didn't like the fact she was. I mentioned so many things to her like:<br>

<br><i>"Why would you marry me below being a disciple and then spring a surprise on me and become a Christian."<i/><br>

<br>"Your life will be aligned differently to mine."<br>

 
<br>"I can't believe you would do that."</i><br>

<br>The fact of the matter is, I didn't take time to learn, and I made assumptions about disciples, the bible and Jesus without taking time out to learn and research.<br></p>
             <p class="heading_three">What non biblical proof do we have of Jesus?</p>
             <p class="sentence_three">There are many credible sources of Jesus throughout history. These sources include:</p>
