<br>Disciples are those who have taken the conscious decision to be born again and accept Jesus Christ. Disciples will give their testimony, which is their journey of life, faith, and why they decided to follow God.<br>

<br>We hope this website provides inspiration to those who are interested in becoming a disciple or looking for answers. Sometimes, in life, your faith will be tested and it can become difficult. This is why togetherness, sharing of faith and testimonies is helpful for yourself and others.</p>

             <p class="sentence_two">Hi, I'm Rehnell, the creator of this website. My journey has been an eventful one. I started off from humble beginnings on an east London estate. I used to idolise famous people, rappers, clothing, cars and all things that are materialistic.<br>

<br>I have been held up by knife point on three occasions and I have been lucky not to be hurt. I have also carried a knife on many occasions, not to cause harm to anyone, but for protection from those who may use a knife against me. I used to get involved in things I shouldn't have, but for some reason God always protected me.<br>

<br>The list would go on and there are too many occasions to mention where I could have either been hurt, arrested or even killed by a stabbing. God looked over me and this was also part of my path to faith, but at that time I couldn't see it. <br>

<br>Despite all of this, my heart was always in the right place and I knew what was right from wrong, and I was lucky not to obtain a criminal record.<br>

<br>I have once sold weed and been a driver on numerous occasions for dealers who were running county lines selling class A drugs.<br>

<br>I started to smoke weed from the age of around 13 or 14, which was way too young, but most importantly I shouldn't have started in the first place. Smoking was more of a social environment for me, as I would gather with friends, smoke weed, play video games, watch movies and/or get takeaways, watch comedy comedies, even sometimes outdoors in the forest or quiet backstreets.<br>


<br>I have been a part of burglaries and theft, such as stealing a moped and clothes from busy Central London department stores.<br>

<br>I loved sex and always used to have nights out in a nightclub looking for fornication. I had a lot of sex and I got super confident of how good I was at it, to the point I generally believed I was a pornstar and looked at women as objects rather than a human being with feelings and emotions. This happened every time I saw women on the street, on TV, the internet, at work and anywhere else where women would be.<br>

<br>I met Ruby in 2008, who is now my wife. We met in central London in a nightclub coincidentaly, and we are still together today.<br>

<br>My wife was not interested, like myself, in Jesus and in Christianity. However, one thing we had in common was we both believed in God. My wife became a disciple in 2021, and I still didn't like the fact she was up until 2024. I mentioned so many things to her like:<br>

<br><i>"Why would you marry me just before being a disciple and then spring a surprise on me."<br>

<br>"Your life will be aligned differently to mine."<br>

 
<br>"I can't believe you would do that."</i><br>

<br>The fact of the matter is, I didn't take time to learn, and I made assumptions about disciples, the bible and Jesus without taking time out to learn and research.<br>

<br>Before I used to question exsistance, why are we here? The chicken or the egg theory, If a man and a woman creates life how did the first human get here? and If there is a God who created god? and how do I know Jesus exsisted? I started to do lots of research into this.<br>

<br>I came to realise that there was lots of non biblical evidence of Jesus from historians, emporers, leaders, writers, politicians and many others that factually exsisted and who wrote and spoke about Jesus. I realised that not only Christianity but Islam and in Judaism they recognise there was a jesus but the diffetent religious faiths interpret him differently.<br>


<br>In most Christian faiths Jesus is the son of god, The Messiah and part of the trinity which is God, Jesus, the Holy spirit and born by the Virgin Mary. In Islam he is also the Messiah, born from the Virgin Mary but considered a prophet. In Judaism they accept that Jesus exsisted but Jews believe Jesus did not fulfill messianic prophecies that establish the criteria for the coming of the messiah.<br>

<br>The one question I struggled with also was <i>"If there is a God, who created God?."</i><br>

<br>When looking at the bible and seeing many scriptures stating that God is everlasting and eternal, so God must have always existed! It then dawned on me after research and all these years thinking of this question that God always existed. When thinking about it, this is the only logical explanation of God, our planet, universe and our existence.<br>

<br>All of this helped me gain faith in God, the bible and Jesus. I became a disciple in 2024, and it is the best decision I have made in my life.<br>

<br>I hope this helps others on their path who are looking to become a disciple, or those who may have questions. We are all not perfect, so we should all not put ourselves down. The best thing you can do is take ownership of your wrong doings and make a conscious decision to make a change for the better.</p>
